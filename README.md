# ImageSearch

##About the Project
this is ImageSearch project whitch presents the simple implement about common image processing, I finished it when I was Junior.

This project include common image-procesing algorithms like Mean filter、SNNFilter、 Sobel、Robert、Priwit、Laplacian、DCT、FFT etc. In addition, It include two image search algorithms whitch based on image's pixel content. The firt is Content Fingerprint based on PHash, the second is pixel Histogram algorithm.
